# Summary of Servo Control GUI Refactoring

## Overview

This refactoring replaced the simple smoothing factor-based servo movement with sophisticated Bezier curve-based motion control. The new system provides precise velocity control by defining keyframes with control points, allowing for more natural, adjustable motion curves between servo positions.

## Modified Files

1. **ESP32 Arduino Code** (`esp_code_accomodating_velocity.ino`)
   - Removed the Global Smoothing Factor (GSF) and associated smoothing logic
   - Added Bezier curve data structures and calculations
   - Implemented sequence playback using keyframes and control points
   - Added new serial commands for sequence loading and playback

2. **config_setup.py**
   - Removed all UI elements and variables related to Global Smoothing Factor
   - Simplified configuration parameters to just number of servos

3. **gui_main.py**
   - Removed Global Smoothing Factor initialization and commands
   - Updated initialization of components to remove GSF parameters

4. **master_control.py**
   - Removed the smoothing control frame and associated widgets
   - Removed Global Smoothing Factor variable and command sending
   - Updated the update button to only manage NUM_SERVOS

5. **single_controls.py**
   - Removed GSF parameter from initialization
   - Updated MasterControl instantiation to remove GSF
   - Removed passing of smoothing commands

6. **sequence_recorder.py**
   - Modified sequence data structure to support Bezier curve keyframes
   - Updated the playback mechanism to use the new serial commands
   - Added conversion functions between internal format and ESP32 format
   - Implemented integration with the motion editor
   - Added support for control points in sequence recording

7. **servo_motion_editor.py** (completely new)
   - Implemented a Matplotlib-based editor for Bezier curve motion profiles
   - Added interactive controls for adjusting keyframes and control points
   - Implemented real-time visualization of motion curves
   - Added servo selection/navigation and playback controls
   - Implemented format conversion between editor and recorder

## Final Data Structure for self.sequence in SequenceRecording

The sequence data is now stored as a list of step dictionaries, where each step contains:

```python
self.sequence = [
    # Step 0
    {
        'time': 0,                 # Absolute time from sequence start in ms
        'delay': 500,              # Delay until next step starts
        'servos': [                # List of servo states at this step
            {
                'id': 0,           # Servo ID
                'position': 90.0,  # Angle value
                'angle': 90.0,     # Duplicate for compatibility
                'cp_in': None,     # No incoming control point for first keyframe
                'cp_out': {        # Outgoing control point (relative to keyframe)
                    'dt': 165.0,   # Delta time in ms
                    'da': 0.0      # Delta angle in degrees
                }
            },
            # ... more servos
        ]
    },
    # Step 1
    {
        'time': 500,               # Time = previous time + previous delay
        'delay': 500,
        'servos': [
            {
                'id': 0,
                'position': 120.0,
                'angle': 120.0,
                'cp_in': {         # Incoming control point
                    'dt': -165.0,  # Negative dt means before the keyframe
                    'da': 0.0
                },
                'cp_out': {        # Outgoing control point
                    'dt': 165.0,   # Positive dt means after the keyframe
                    'da': -5.0
                }
            },
            # ... more servos
        ]
    },
    # ... more steps
]
```

## Final Serial Command Set

1. **Retained Commands:**
   - `NUM_SERVOS:{num_servos}`: Sets the number of active servos
   - `MA:{angle}`: Sets the master angle for all active servos
   - `SA:{servo_id}:{angle}`: Sets the angle for a specific servo
   - `STOP`: Stops all playback and motion

2. **New Commands:**
   - `CLEAR_ALL`: Clears all loaded sequences from the ESP's memory
